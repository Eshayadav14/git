How the Component Works

Functionality:

The Title component allows content authors to create standalone or sectional titles with full control over typography, color, and stylistic variations. It enables the selection of title type (H1-H5), font color, background color, text alignment, and decorative styles like strokes. The component adjusts typography and layout responsively across devices and breakpoints.

Major Elements:
	•	Title Container: Wrapper div that defines the title style based on font weight and variation.
	•	Title Wrapper: Optional padded container for background color or stroke variations.
	•	Title Text Block: The actual heading text, semantically wrapped in an H1-H5 element.
	•	Anchor Link (Optional): If a URL is provided, the title becomes a clickable link.
