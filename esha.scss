How the Component Works

Functionality:

	•	Supports two variations:
	1.	With Save Amount (below image)
	2.	Without Save Amount (displays quantity instead)
	•	Coupon tiles link to external or internal URLs, with optional “open in new tab” behavior.
	•	ADA compliant and responsive across all screen sizes.

⸻

Major Elements:
	•	Price Display:
Variation 1 uses Saveprice; variation 2 uses price with quantity and “for” text.
	•	Image and Alt Text:
Displays a product image along with alt text for accessibility.
	•	Save Amount:
Variation 1 displays a text like “Save 50¢” below the image.
	•	Quantity (Variation 2 only):
Indicates the quantity and pricing (e.g., “3 for $7”).
	•	Clickable Tile:
Entire tile is wrapped in a link, supporting target="_blank" behavior.
	•	Grey Background Header:
Top half of each coupon tile includes a grey-colored background as per FIGMA specs.
	•	Tracking Attributes:
AEM analytics tracking data attributes are included in the tile container.
