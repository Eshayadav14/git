Additional Information:
Customization & Theming:

The Banner component can be customized by modifying the SCSS file and updating the JSON configuration from AEM.

No external libraries are required.
Utility functions:
'pushEventOnComponentClicked' for analytics tracking.
'CAROUSEL_TYPE' for data layer constants.
Variations:

The Banner component supports A to Z variations, each with unique styles and layouts.
Note:

When adding banners in a grid-like structure, you must author them using the Column Control Component to ensure proper alignment and responsiveness.
Please prepare a documentation for CTA component just like banner component. CTA button functionality includes everything about button and tooltips and popovers come up on the button. Also there's an ID that we author on cta button and modal component both, which will basically open the modal. if ID is authored then modal functionality works otherwise tooltips and popovers are there.
