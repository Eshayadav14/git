Author should be able to configure the PAGE HEADER component in AEM. The page header component should be a custom component with fields to author the title & the help text

The Page Header Component is a section at the top of the webpage that includes the title of the content described on the page.

Author should be able to configure the Header component with the title and the help text

The page header should have a title, back button and helper text.

The maximum limit of the page title is 50 characters as the title component

If the page title is longer, then the helper text appears below the page title.

The helper text is clickable and is hyperlinked to the content page.
