Overview

Component Name: Carousel
Type: Dynamic
Component Variations:
	•	Static Carousel (OOTB)
	•	Smart Carousel (Enhanced/Configurable)

The Carousel component serves as a container for scrollable, horizontally arranged content. It supports two variations:
	1.	Static Carousel – a simple out-of-the-box (OOTB) implementation that renders one item per page with minimal configuration.
	2.	Smart Carousel – an enhanced version that introduces layout flexibility, responsive behavior, and authoring controls via AEM.

	•	Customization: Limited.
	•	Splide Configuration: Minimal; mostly hardcoded or default.

	•	OOTB: Yes.

2. Smart Carousel
	•	Behavior: Displays multiple items per page (customizable per screen size).
	•	Customization: Extensive configuration through AEM dialogs.
	•	Splide Configuration: Fully customizable with authoring fields.
