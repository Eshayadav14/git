Hey [Team Lead’s Name],

As today is my last day on the project, I just wanted to say a heartfelt thank you. You’ve been an incredible team lead—your calm approach, problem-solving, and guidance have truly made an impact, and I’ve learned so much from you.

I know I haven’t been very vocal recently with all the defect fixes going on, but I’ve always admired how smoothly you handled everything and led the team. That one-on-one chat really stuck with me—it made me reflect on staying better connected with you, and that’s something I’ll definitely work on going forward.

I’ve always enjoyed supporting teammates like Harshitha, Suhas, and new joiners whenever possible, and I’ll continue doing that in future projects too. I’ve also been using the recent downtime to focus on upskilling through some courses.

Thanks again for all the support. Hope we get to work together again soon. Wishing you the very best!
