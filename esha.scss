Same way I need to create for Catogory-tiles: 
here's the Jira description for component:
As an end user, I want to be able to view categories in dollar general, so that I can know more about the categories and the products from the categories

Business / Functional Goals:

The categories should be visible in tiles view and should consists of below elements

Category Image
Category Title
Note: The category tiles in carousel view will be covered with the development of dynamic carousels but this story should cover the list view of category tiles with the "see all categories" link

The category tiles should be shown in a vertical list view in the APP but in the grid view in Web

Category tiles have three different sizes 

Small
Medium
