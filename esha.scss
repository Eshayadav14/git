Business / Functional Goals:

The content author should be able to author the Carousel options fields of the Smart carousel component in AMS in the future Static carousel component so that they are able to get the capabilities of the Smart carousel component

Acceptance Criteria:

AC1 | FE | View of the Static and Smart carousel variations

GIVEN I am an end user on DG.COM

WHEN I am viewing Static and Smart carousels

THEN the carousel design should be as per Figma

AND the no. of items visible in the carousel per page on the Desktop/Tablet/Mobile should be as per the authors selection

AND as Banner have a min width, for that reason even if the author add a 4 count is not being displayed as 4 per page. But if other components are used, then authors should be able to choose size of each using layout column control

AND the view of the only items with 4 count per page, 3 count per page, 2 count per page and 1 count per page should be as per Figma in all the screen size

AND the carousel container should change the size based on the layout

AND the carousel buttons and steppers should be visible in XXL, XL, L and M screen size

AND the carousel buttons should not be visible in S and XS screen size

AND only the steppers should be visible in S and XS screen size

AND as images have aspect ratio, they should maintain that aspect ratio in the carousel

Note: Other items such as Featured tiles, shoppable images, coupon preview would be added later to the static and smart carousel
